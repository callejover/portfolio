Here I will write down supporting comments to be able to put together a full description of this project.

  Starting up a webpage
  Finding inspiraton of a simple portfolio. I want a minimalized theme.
  Adding pictures from the web. Final pictures will come.
  Working with a simple mockup for about half a page when Bootstrap lesson in school.
  Creating a branch that will use Bootstrap.
